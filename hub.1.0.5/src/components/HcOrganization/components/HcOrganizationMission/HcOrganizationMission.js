				<h3>The Museum&apos;s Mission</h3>

				<p>
					The Museum’s mission is to play a leading role in transforming 
					the nation’s relationship with science and technology.
				</p>

				<p>
					This role becomes ever more important as science and technology 
					shape and reshape our lives and world, and it means we:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Promote active citizenship informed by the world of 
						science and technology
					</li>
					<li>Inspire lifelong appreciation of the importance and 
						impact of science and engineering
					</li>
					<li>
						Encourage young people of all backgrounds to explore 
						and develop their interests in understanding the natural 
						and human-made world
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					To do this, we will continue to build our position as a leader 
					in the world’s museum community and use our educational perspective 
					as an informal learning institution to help the formal 
					pre K – 12 education system.
				</p>


				<h3>The Museum&apos;s Vision</h3>

				<p>
					The Museum of Science believes that everyone has a role to play 
					in the world of science and technology &mdash; as learners, as 
					future scientists or engineers, as citizens of our nation, as 
					community leaders and members of the workforce, as consumers, 
					and as stewards of our planet.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Museum of Science is committed to deepening the public&apos;s 
					relationship with science and technology by leading efforts 
					throughout the United States and abroad, in both formal and 
					informal educational arenas, to redefine the roles that science 
					centers can play.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Within our own building, we will continuously transform our 
						exhibits and programs to tell a story of the natural world and 
						the designed world that focuses on the important connections, 
						sustainability and interdependencies of these worlds.
					</li>
					<li>
						Throughout New England, we will form partnerships with all 
						sectors to enrich our offerings, to represent the cutting 
						edge of science and technology, and to take our invitation 
						into science and technology out to schools and neighborhoods 
						in order to build and strengthen our community.
					</li>
					<li>Throughout the nation, and the world, we will take a leadership 
						role in integrating engineering into school curricula, in 
						forming networks with other Museums to engage visitors 
						everywhere in exploring the impact of science and technology 
						on their lives, and in developing an expanded role for science 
						centers as conveners of forums on critical societal issues.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Through these efforts, the Museum of Science will foster communities 
					near and far in which all citizens have access to the worlds of 
					science and technology and the knowledge and skills to make informed 
					decisions about the issues and developments shaping their lives and 
					our planet’s future.
